Job to do

Use the hotels-europe dataset and pick a city (other than Vienna). Each student/pair should
pick a different city with at least 250 hotels in the dataset after appropriate filtering of the
data. Sign up with the city chosen in this spreadsheet.
Once the city is chosen, first combine the prices dataset with the hotel features dataset. Then,
use hotel user ratings to create a binary variable: highly_rated=1 if rating â‰¥ 4, 0 otherwise.
Examine how high rating is related to the other hotel features in the data. Make sure to
document and argue for the data cleaning/filtering decisions you make.
Estimate linear probability, logit, and probit models with distance and stars as explanatory
variables. You may add other variables if you wish.
Compare coefficients, marginal differences, and predicted probabilities, and discuss your
results.
